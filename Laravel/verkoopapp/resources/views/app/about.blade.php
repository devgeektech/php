          <p><strong>Posting Rules &amp; Terms of service</strong></p>
          <p>We&rsquo;re here to give our customers a free and easy way to buy and sell Animals and their Accessories. To help that happen, we have some rules we need you to follow.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>What are the rules?</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>You&rsquo;re only allowed one account. Our policies are per person, not per account. Only use one.</li>
            <li>No contact details in titles or descriptions. Please add them to the right fields. That way you&rsquo;ll have more room to describe what you&rsquo;re selling.</li>
            <li>Clean, clear and accurate photos please. We&rsquo;ll ask you to take them down if you add contact details to them. Or if they lie about what you&rsquo;re selling. For example, posting a picture of an animal that isn&rsquo;t yours.</li>
            <li>No links to other websites in your ad. We will not accept links to other websites when you post your ad.</li>
            <li>Choose the best category you can. This will give you the best exposure and keep our site clean and tidy.</li>
            <li>Only sell it if you have it. Wait till you have it before you try to sell it.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>For a few more rules specific to our categories, take a look below:</p>
          <p><strong>Pets Category</strong></p>
          <p>We will delete any ads we believe are encouraging or indicate signs of animal cruelty. We may also refer them for investigation.</p>
          <p><strong>The big rules</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Post photos of the actual animal instead of a picture you find online.</li>
            <li>The animal needs to be at least 8 weeks old or appropriate age before leaving the mother.</li>
            <li>If you&rsquo;re selling equipment, it needs to be sold separately at its appropriate category.</li>
            <li>We don&rsquo;t allow illegal animals and if we find will be reported to appropriate authorities.</li>
            <li>Animals advertised as good for work, or with reference to working parents aren&rsquo;t allowed. Even if it&rsquo;s a guard dog or a racing pigeon.</li>
            <li>Pregnant animals aren&rsquo;t allowed.</li>
            <li>We don&rsquo;t allow ads selling animals for food.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t ship animals or swap them for other animals, services or items.</li>
            <li>Don&rsquo;t sell or give away your pet to anyone under the age of 18.</li>
            <li>No ads promoting fighting (Unless legal). And no ads selling or trading animals for fighting (unless legal).</li>
            <li>We don&rsquo;t allow any reference to animals being sold as Christmas or any regional event.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>What if someone keeps breaking the rules?</strong></p>
          <p>We remove their ads. Every time we do, we send them an email to let them know why. If they carry on, we permanently ban them and report them to appropriate authorities.</p>
