                  <p>Upon launching theVerkoop app for the first time, you will be prompted to sign up or
                    login with Facebook, an email address or Google+ (for Android users only only).
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Email sign up</strong></p>
                  <p>To create a Verkoop account using your email address, perform the following steps:</p>
                  <p>Select “Sign up or Log in with Email”<br>
                    Enter your choice of username, password, email address, and city<br>

                  <p><strong>Facebook sign up</strong></p>
                  <p>To create a Verkoop account using Facebook, you’ll need to have a verified Facebook
                    account. Perform the following steps on yourVerkoop homescreen:
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Select “Sign up or Login with Facebook”</strong></p>
                  <p>Next, you'll be able to choose to sign up using details from your Facebook app (if
                    you have it installed), or by manually entering your Facebook credentials. To be
                    sure, we recommend selecting “Log in with Phone Number or Email Address” to
                    accurately sign up with the intended Facebook account
                    Then, select “Log in” and depending on the username availability, you may be
                    redirected to a page for you to change yourVerkoop username
                    That's it! For future logins, simply click on the ""Sign up or Login with Facebook""
                    option and you'll be directed to yourVerkoop account under 2 clicks!
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Google mail sign up (for Android users only)</strong></p>
                  <p>If you have an existing Google Mail account or want to sign up for one, select the
                    Google option on the app home screen. When prompted, just sign in to your existing
                    Google+ account or create a new one!

                  <br>
                  <P>Thereafter, you should have also received a verification email from us to verify your

                  <br>
                  <p>As long as the item has not been marked as sold or reserved, it will still be available in the marketplace for otherVerkoopers to search, view and start chats on. </p>
                  <P>However, if you only have one of the item in stock, it is not encouraged to accept multiple offers as the acceptance of offer is irreversible and signifies a commitment to deal. Once an offer has been made and accepted, both parties will be able to leave a feedback for each other.</P>
                  <p>Accepting a single offer would be ideal in this case, as accepting multiple offers would mean that multiple unhappy buyers will be able to leave a feedback on your profile if they wish to."</p>

                  <p>"Unfortunately, it is not possible to list items under more than one sub-category. We understand that at times, it may be possible that items could fall under multiple sub-categories. However, the purpose of subcategories are to help streamline searches and the best way to achieve this would be for items to be listed in only one sub-category.</p>
                  <p>In cases whereby you think your item can be categorised in more than one sub-category, we would advise you to choose the one sub-category which best fits the item and list it under that sub-category. </p>
                  <p>Not to worry though, we're always looking to improve on our categorisation model depending on market demand and popularity and there's always a possibility that we will improve the categorisation flow"</p>
